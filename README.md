Nutritional Data iOS App
This food nutritional value application will help users find out nutritional value based on the food item of their choice. This app will allow the user to input any food item UPC code and get the nutritional value of that item. It will then display the values to the user with an extra button to take the user to a website where the user can verify the integrity of the values. The app will store the history of the items and their nutritional values using core data. It will have MapKit implemented so the user can see nearby grocery stores within a 5 or 10-mile radius.
